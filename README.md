## About Me

**Juan Pablo Monsalve Suazo | multix20**
Primary School Teacher | Full Stack Developer (JS) | Self-taught Linux SysAdmin

I'm a passionate educator with a deep interest in technology and autonomous learning. I completed a full stack development bootcamp focused on **JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases**, and have independently developed strong skills in **Linux system administration**, particularly using **Ubuntu Server**.

My professional journey bridges education and IT, where I aim to bring meaningful impact through technology. Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge in server automation, network management, and I aspire to work with **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** environments in the near future.

This repository is a showcase of my learning path, hands-on projects, and practical tools â€” all created with the purpose of making technology more accessible and purposeful.
